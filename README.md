# my IoT projects
This is a collection of small and bigger projects based on microcontrollers. Mostly they are based on amazing ESP32 CPU. Some of these feature:
- RPi based self driving car (based on Lidar readings)
- ESP32 Cam projects (including timelapse ready solution)
- electronic clock
- thermometer (both BME180/280 and DS18B20 based)
- projects connecting to cloud (AWS) solutions - IoT platform

Many credits go to [Rui Santos](https://github.com/RuiSantosdotme) for his great tutorials that always were great inspiration to me and ["a guy with the Swiss accent from Youtube"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ) Andreas Spiees who sparks interest.
